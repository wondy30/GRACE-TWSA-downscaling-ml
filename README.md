# GRACE-TWSA-downscaling-ml
This repo consists of a complete MATLAB based code used to downscale GRACE TWSA into groundwater storage anomaly using machine learning.
The code is based on the work by Seyoum, Kwon, and Milewski, titled: Downscaling GRACE TWSA Data into High-Resolution Groundwater Level Anomaly Using Machine Learning-Based Models in a Glacial Aquifer System published on Remote Sensing Journal, https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11070824.
